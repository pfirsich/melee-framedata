<h1 class="movename">Melee Framedata</h1>
<p>This website contains in-depth frame data for Super Smash Bros. Melee and is made by <a href="https://theshoemaker.de/">Joel Schumacher</a> based on framedata JSON files generated by <a href="https://github.com/pfirsich/meleeFrameDataExtractor">meleeFrameDataExtractor</a>. The design is somewhat inspired by the move pages on <a href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/Samus_(SSBM)/Neutral_aerial">SmashWiki</a>.</p>

<p>Currently Ice Climbers are missing completely (since them being two characters introduces a couple of complications) and only <a href="http://melee-framedata.theshoemaker.de/samus">Samus</a> has gfys for the moves. If you want to add gfys for other characters, please follow <a href="https://github.com/pfirsich/melee-framedata/blob/master/addingGfys.md">the guide</a> and contact me if necessary!</p>

<p>The move pages on this site are generated automatically and since there are about 500 of them, I haven't verified them all. If you find mistakes, please post an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/pfirsich/melee-framedata">GitHub page!</a></p>
